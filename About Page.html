    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <section>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Ricardo Hernández</strong>, a bilingual (English/Spanish) engineer with a strong background in <strong>data analytics, automation, and process improvement</strong>.</p>

      <p>Currently, I work at <strong>Collins Aerospace</strong> as a <em>Data Analytics Engineer II</em>, where I automate data pipelines and deliver actionable insights that influence high-level decision-making and improve reliability strategies. I also have hands-on experience with tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Power Automate to streamline processes and enhance efficiency.</p>

      <p>Before my current role, I held positions in both general engineering and analytics, consistently using <strong>Lean Six Sigma</strong> principles to drive results. From creating automated dashboards to eliminating manual workflows, I’ve helped teams improve operational efficiency and reduce errors across engineering and pricing systems.</p>
