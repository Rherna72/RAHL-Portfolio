  <h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>

  <h3>Automated Data Pipeline — Collins Aerospace (2025)</h3>
  <p>
    Designed and implemented end-to-end automated data pipelines using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong> to replace manual data entry and reporting processes across engineering teams. The solution reduced manual reporting time by over <strong>40%</strong> and significantly increased data reliability. Using error handling and logging mechanisms, the pipeline maintained a high level of data integrity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Final dashboards were integrated with reporting tools and shared with stakeholders to enable real-time decision-making. The insights generated helped leadership make data-driven capital investment decisions and prioritize long-term reliability strategies for high-value assets.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, SQL, Excel, SharePoint, Power BI</p>

  <h3>Power BI Dashboard & Workflow Automation — Collins Aerospace (2024)</h3>
  <p>
    Collaborated with operations and engineering teams to design interactive <strong>Power BI dashboards</strong> that provided live insights into bottlenecks in production processes. Through DAX formulas and custom visuals, the dashboards revealed key areas of delay, enabling the company to optimize work cell layouts and reduce process cycle time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, built multiple workflow automations using <strong>Power Automate</strong> and custom <strong>JSON logic</strong>, eliminating redundant tasks like status updates and manual task assignments. This improved efficiency and accuracy across departments while cutting down administrative workload.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Power BI, Power Automate, Excel, JSON, Teams, SharePoint</p>

  <h3>Pricing Quality Improvement Project — Honeywell Aerospace (2023)</h3>
  <p>
    Spearheaded a pricing quality project to detect and eliminate inconsistencies in over 200,000 part numbers across 7 catalog tables. Using <strong>Power BI</strong>, I designed a data model that uncovered more than <strong>6,000 pricing errors</strong>, enabling leadership to take corrective action.
  </p>
  <p>
    To prevent recurring issues, I created a <strong>PowerApps tool</strong> that allowed team members to enter, validate, and approve pricing data through a clean and structured UI. This drastically reduced file redundancy and improved pricing data quality across the board.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Power BI, PowerApps, Excel, SQL, SharePoint</p>

  <h3>Manufacturing System Design Project — MC Green Solutions (2023)</h3>
  <p>
    As part of my final undergraduate capstone, I worked with a real-world manufacturing client, <strong>MC Green Solutions</strong>, to analyze and improve their plant layout and system performance. I used <strong>MATLAB simulations</strong> to model different layout options and identify areas of congestion, imbalance, and inefficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    After running several scenarios, I proposed a new facility layout using <strong>AutoCAD</strong> that would reduce average haulage distances by <strong>52%</strong>. The design was presented to and approved by plant leadership and has since been considered as part of their operational expansion plans.
